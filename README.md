# Project_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_and_GBM

This is a notebook about the Monte Carlo methods and more precisely the Geometric Brownian Motion model and the application on such to the financial stock markets data. All is packed up in a finalized function, but there is a lot of explanations and examples in the whole notebook, including a some easy to understand (I think) plots.
